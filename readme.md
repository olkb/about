## General help

The main place to get help is the official support/news subreddit, [/r/olkb](http://reddit.com/r/olkb) - the community is great at jumping in to help out others, and Jack comments on things when necessary. If you have a question specifically for Jack, there are weekly question threads where you can ask questions.

## Order Status
