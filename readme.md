OLKB is a small online shop based out of Fort Wayne, Indiana run by [Jack Humbert](https://jackhumbert.com), with help from Sebastiaan on customer service/operations, and another local company that helps with fulfillment. Everything on the store is in stock unless stated otherwise. If you order in-stock items along with a group buy, all of the items will ship when the group buy is ready. For updates on group buys, check out the [group buy page](https://olkb.com/group-buys). For general updates, [Jack often posts things to the subreddit as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/search?q=Update+author%3Ajackhumbert&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all).

## General help

The main place to get help is the official support/news subreddit, [/r/olkb](http://reddit.com/r/olkb) - the community is great at jumping in to help out others, and Jack comments on things when necessary.

## Changes to orders

If you'd like to add something to your order, please request to cancel your previous order first, and re-order things completely - merging orders is a bit too difficult right now. To cancel, please [email hello@olkb.com](mailto:hello@olkb.com) with your full order number, and your refund will be issued as soon as possible.

## Problems

If you've received your order and are having issues with something, need to change your address, or anything else with your order, [please email help@olkb.com with your full order number](mailto:help@olkb.com), and we'll get it taken care of as soon as possible.
